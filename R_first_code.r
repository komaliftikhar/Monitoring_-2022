# this is my first code in github! its very exciting.
# here are input data on streams.

# costanza data on streams
WATER <- c(100,200,300,400,500)
WATER
#marta data on fishes genomes
fishes <- c(10,50,60,100,200) 
fishes

# plot the diversity of fishes (y) versus the amount of water (x)
plot(WATER, fishes)

# the data we developed can be stored in a table
# a table in R is called data frame

streams <- data.frame(WATER, fishes)
